# Deep-Learning-based-Image-Caption-Generator
# üñºÔ∏è Image Caption Generator (CNN + LSTM)

This project implements an **Image Caption Generator** using **Deep Learning** techniques.  
It combines a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for image feature extraction with a **Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM)** for generating descriptive captions in natural language.  

---

## Project Overview
- **Dataset:** Flickr8k (8,000 images with 5 captions each)  
- **Model:** CNN (InceptionV3) + LSTM  
- **Frameworks:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras  
- **Goal:** Generate accurate captions for unseen images by learning the mapping between image features and natural language.

## Features
- Image preprocessing and feature extraction using pre-trained **InceptionV3**  
- Caption preprocessing with tokenization and padding  
- Sequence modeling with **LSTM**  
- Evaluation using **BLEU scores**  
- Inference script to generate captions for custom images
